### Project Overview
---
The goal of this project is to calculate the High Risk Percentage (prevalence) across a patient population and provide health professionals with a searchable interface to drill down into specific patient metrics like cholesterol, blood pressure, and ST depression.

Key Metrics & Calculations

High Risk %: A dynamic DAX measure calculating the ratio of patients with heart disease against the total population.

Presence vs. Absence: Visual breakdown of diagnostic results.

Key Risk Indicators: Analysis of Chest Pain Type, Max HR, and Thallium levels.
